# Reinforcement Learning Using OpenAI Gym's Taxi ðŸš•

In this notebook, i've applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train an agent to solve the 'Taxi' environment from OpenAI Gym using the Q-learning algorithm.

## RL and Taxi Environment

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The 'Taxi' environment is a classic problem where the agent's goal is to pick up passengers and drop them off at their destinations using the least number of moves.
